# Practical Autoinstall Example for Ubuntu Desktop

Assuming you have installation media (a USB stick) with Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 on it. Simply drop this file onto the highest level directory of the USB.

Initiate the install process on the new machine and step through the setup. When you get to the Installation page, select the `autoinstall` option and choose to boot from a file. Provide the path to the autoinstall file like so `file:///<name of autoinstall.yml>` and validate the install.

If formed properly, the entire system should be up and running in about 15 minutes with all your favorite packages and (most) settings already configured!
